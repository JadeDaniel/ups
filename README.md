Ups is a priority tool. 

Formalize applying your values to your To-Do list.

We are always aiming at something. Hopefully, it's something better in some way than the status quo, the way things are today.

We have an infinity of things we could work on at any given time, but only one of them is the thing we should do RIGHT NOW.

Ups is designed to help you sort all the things you could do, to find the one that lines up with the thing you are aiming at.
